# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Initial project audit and Memory Bank setup.
- Understanding the overall structure and purpose of the `adk-samples` repository.

## Recent Changes

- Created the `memory-bank` directory.
- Populated core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) based on the root `README.md` and project structure.

## Next Steps

- Further explore individual agent implementations within the `agents/` directory as needed.
- Await user direction for specific tasks related to one or more sample agents.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Determining the level of detail required for documenting each individual sample agent.
