# Product Context

## Problem Solved

Developers needing to build agents for various tasks often start from scratch. This repository solves this by providing pre-built, functional sample agents based on the ADK, reducing initial development time and effort.

## How it Works

- Users clone the repository.
- Navigate to the `agents/` directory.
- Choose a specific sample agent (e.g., `llm-auditor`, `travel-concierge`).
- Follow the agent-specific `README.md` for setup (dependencies via Poetry, `.env` configuration).
- Run the agent.
- Customize the agent logic or integrations as needed.

## User Experience Goals

- Provide clear instructions for setup and execution of each sample agent.
- Offer well-structured and understandable code examples.
- Make it easy for developers to adapt and extend the sample agents for their specific needs.
